 * Executes a handler for every managed resource in tuple order, collecting

 * Enforcement is triple-layered:
 *  1. Compile-time - HandlerMap requires a key for every resource in R
 *  2. Runtime - iteration is driven by the `resources` tuple (source of truth)
 *  3. Structural - the return type feeds into DeployTarget's return types
