/**
 * Order services so every service deploys AFTER the ones it lists in
 * `depends_on`. A stable topological sort: at each step it emits, in declaration
 * order, every not-yet-emitted service whose dependencies are all already
 * emitted - so two independent services keep their nextnode.toml order and the
 * result is deterministic run to run.
 *
 * Throws on a dependency cycle (naming the services still tangled) - a cycle has
 * no valid deploy order, so failing loud beats deploying in an arbitrary one.
 * `depends_on` refs are validated against the declared set upstream, so an
 * unknown ref never reaches here.
