# Infrastructure

Cloudflare Workers deployment CLI, run by GitHub Actions from a checkout of this repository. This package is not published to npm.

## Configuration

```toml
[project]
name = "my-app"
type = "app"
domain = "example.com"

[deploy.services.web]
entry = "dist/server/entry.mjs"
url = "example.com"
needs = ["d1"]

[services.d1]
```

`deploy.target` is optional and only accepts `cloudflare-workers`. Static assets use `entry = false` and an `assets` directory. Backing services are D1, KV, Queues, R2 and PlanetScale. Secrets are not declared here: every Worker receives the secrets of the repository's Infisical project, described under [Secrets](#secrets).

## Organization settings

GitHub organization Actions variables are the source of organization settings. Set `TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION` for every deployment. Set `PLANETSCALE_ORGANIZATION` when using PlanetScale. A project with an internal Worker additionally requires `COMPANY_DOMAIN` and `ACCESS_SESSION_DURATION` for its Access email policy and session lifetime. The CLI rejects missing settings, with no company-specific defaults.

Deployment credentials live in the CI project of the vault: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `TF_CLOUD_TOKEN`, `NEXTNODE_APP_ID`, `NEXTNODE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` and `NPM_TOKEN`. PlanetScale requires `PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN_ID` and `PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN`. The Terraform token must be a team or user token, not an organization token. Internal deployments need Cloudflare Access Apps and Policies permission.

## Secrets

Infisical is the only source of secrets. GitHub holds none, and `nextnode.toml` declares none. GitHub Variables stay in GitHub because they are not secrets. Secrets sit at the root of an environment, with no folder.

| Infisical project                             | Environments  | Content                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| The CI project, id `INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID`     | `main`        | Platform credentials shared by every pipeline |
| One per repository, named like the repository | `dev`, `prod` | The secrets of that repository's Workers      |

### A repository's secrets

The `deploy` job looks up the project named after the calling repository among the projects the pipeline identity is a member of. It reads `dev` for a development deploy and `prod` for production, the environments Infisical creates with every project. Each Worker with a script then holds exactly these secrets: new ones are added, changed ones updated, deleted ones removed. A static-assets-only Worker receives none. A repository without a project deploys with a warning and its Workers keep their secrets. A secret changed in Infisical reaches the Workers at the next deploy.

To give a repository secrets:

1. Create an Infisical project with the repository's exact name.
2. Add the identity `github-actions` to it, with the built-in role Viewer.
3. Store the secrets in `dev` and `prod`.

Locally, `infisical init` links the checkout to the project, and `infisical run --env=dev -- pnpm dev` replaces `.env.local`.

The app types the secrets it reads by augmenting `Cloudflare.Env` in its own declaration file. `worker-types` generates the bindings and vars only.

No secret reaches the build. A value the build needs is not a secret, and goes in a GitHub Variable. The build receives `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` from a repository Variable, `PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` from the deployed environment and `SENTRY_RELEASE` from the commit SHA.

### Loading in a job

Every job that needs a secret starts with `node src/index.ts load-secrets`. The job trades its GitHub OIDC token for a short-lived vault token, then exposes each platform secret as a masked step output, `steps.vault.outputs.<NAME>`. With `PIPELINE_ENVIRONMENT` set, it also emits the repository's secrets as one JSON output, `PROJECT_SECRETS`. Only `deploy` sets it. Never reference `secrets.<NAME>` in a workflow.

A calling workflow declares its permissions, `id-token: write` included, so it keeps working if the organization's default token becomes read-only:

```yaml
permissions:
    contents: read
    actions: read
    id-token: write

jobs:
    deploy:
        uses: NextNodeSolutions/infrastructure/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
        with:
            environment: development
```

A caller of `plan-diff.yml` grants `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write` and `id-token: write`. No caller passes `secrets: inherit`.

### Trust boundary

Any step of a job granted `id-token: write` can mint the job's OIDC token, and the vault accepts it. The identity reads every project it is a member of, so the boundary is what runs in such a job.

- Such a job runs the pipeline CLI only. The caller's dependencies install and its build runs in the `build` job of `deploy.yml`, which holds no credential. `deploy` ships the uploaded result and never installs the caller's dependencies, so the Worker bundle must be self-contained. The exception is a PlanetScale migration, which runs the caller's migrate command in `migrate`.
- `publish-package.yml` is bound to this repository. Its `publish` job runs the package's release tooling, caller code by construction, so it refuses any other calling repository. This repository's code and lockfile are the trusted base, like the CLI.
- The CLI picks the repository's project from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, which the runner sets, so a caller cannot point its pipeline at another repository's project.

The `job_workflow_ref` claim is what the identity trusts: only this repository's workflow files on `main` can log in, whichever repository calls them. In a called workflow the claim names the called file. In a workflow run directly, such as teardown, it names that workflow's own file. The `repository_owner_id` claim pins the organization by its immutable id. This trust is exactly as strong as the protection of this repository's `main`: no direct push, pull requests only.

### Vault setup

Created once: the CI project with its environment `main`, and one organization identity, `github-actions`, with the organization role No Access. It is a member of the CI project with the built-in role Member, and of each repository's project with the built-in role Viewer. Its id is the organization Variable `INFISICAL_IDENTITY_ID`. OIDC Auth:

| Field                       | Value                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OIDC Discovery URL          | `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`                          |
| Issuer                      | `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`                          |
| Subject                     | `repo:NextNodeSolutions*`                                              |
| Audiences                   | `https://app.infisical.com`                                            |
| Claim `repository_owner_id` | `259621712`                                                            |
| Claim `job_workflow_ref`    | `NextNodeSolutions/infrastructure/.github/workflows/*@refs/heads/main` |
| Access token TTL, max TTL   | 900                                                                    |

Infisical matches the Subject as one glob, with no comma list. Repositories created since July 15, 2026 carry GitHub's immutable subject, `repo:NextNodeSolutions@259621712/<repo>@<id>:…`, and cannot opt out, so the glob covers both forms. The Subject is not the trust boundary: `repository_owner_id` pins the organization and `job_workflow_ref` pins this repository's workflows. Claims accept a comma-separated list per claim. A claim mapped through Claim Mapping must be present in every token, otherwise the login is refused.

## CI

Call `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with `environment` and optional `config_file`. Development prefixes the configured hostname with `dev.`. Terraform provisions resources before D1 and PlanetScale migrations. Wrangler deploys code and checks public routed Workers at `/healthz`. Every `.map` file is removed from a Worker's assets directory before upload, so source maps are never served.

`internal = true` on a routed service puts it behind Cloudflare Access, with one Access application per service and environment. `project.internal = true` sets the default for every routed service, and a service's own `internal` overrides it either way, so an internal project can keep a webhook receiver public. An internal service needs a `url`. Each internal Worker receives the public var `ACCESS_AUD`, its application's audience tag, to verify the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header without a hand-copied setting. The JWT issuer is the organization's Zero Trust team domain, which the Worker knows. Keep `ACCESS_AUD` out of the repository's Infisical project. Internal services skip the smoke check because CI has no Access login. Verify the Access login redirect separately.

`.github/workflows/plan-diff.yml` reports Terraform changes on pull requests. It keeps one comment per project and environment and edits it on every run. A plan without changes posts nothing unless an earlier comment exists, which it then refreshes. The step summary always holds the plan. `.github/workflows/teardown.yml` is manually dispatched with target repository, environment and project-name confirmation. Stateful teardown additionally requires `wipe_data`. HCP workspace history remains after teardown.

PlanetScale migrations use `services.planetscale.migrate_command`, defaulting to the command defined in `domain/deploy/target.ts`, from the directory containing `nextnode.toml`. Only the migration subprocess receives `DATABASE_URL` built from sensitive migrator outputs.

## Checks

```sh
pnpm --filter @nextnode-solutions/infrastructure type-check
pnpm --filter @nextnode-solutions/infrastructure lint
pnpm --filter @nextnode-solutions/infrastructure build
```

Infrastructure tests were deleted by operator request. Successful compilation does not prove deployment, Access login or PlanetScale migrations.

Layer rules are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
